An innovative solution for early detection of lung diseases using AI.

---

## Introduction

*IBharatM Health Care AI* is a cutting-edge healthcare project aimed at assisting medical professionals and individuals in identifying lung diseases like *COVID-19, **Pneumonia, and normal conditions from chest X-rays. Built using **Microsoft Azure Custom Vision Service, the application predicts disease probabilities and provides an interactive interface for better analysis. The project also integrates the **Microsoft Health Bot Service*, offering users healthcare-related guidance.

---

## Features
- *Chest X-ray Disease Detection*: Predict lung diseases from uploaded or URL-based chest X-rays.
- *Interactive Visualizations*: Analyze predictions using bar graphs, pie charts, and progress bars.
- *Health Bot Assistance*: Get healthcare-related advice and information from the integrated bot.
- *User-Friendly Interface: A sleek desktop application built with **PySide6*.

---

## Technology Stack
- *Programming Language*: Python 3.8+
- *Cloud Services*: Microsoft Azure Custom Vision, Microsoft Health Bot
- *Libraries*:
  - PySide6: GUI framework
  - Pillow: Image processing
  - Requests: API interaction
  - Matplotlib: Data visualization

## How It Works
1. *Custom Vision AI Model*: Trained on datasets of chest X-ray images (COVID-19, pneumonia, normal lungs).
   - Upload or link an X-ray image.
   - Get predictions for potential diseases with associated probabilities.
2. *Interactive Results*:
   - View results in graph formats (bar graph, pie chart, etc.).
3. *Health Bot*:
   - Provides healthcare information, including disease symptoms, tips, and general assistance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- An active internet connection for API calls.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ibharatm-healthcare-ai.git
   cd ibharatm-healthcare-ai
2.  Install dependencies:
   bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
   
   python main.py

## Usage
Launch the application.
Upload a chest X-ray image or provide a URL.
Wait for the AI model to analyze the image.
View the prediction results along with interactive graphs.
Use the Health Bot for further healthcare-related guidance.

##  Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Follow these steps:

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


## Configure API Keys
Add your Azure Custom Vision Prediction Key and Endpoint in the predict_image() function in the main.py file:

headers = {
    "Prediction-Key": "YOUR_AZURE_PREDICTION_KEY"
}
url = "YOUR_AZURE_CUSTOM_VISION_URL"


## Requirements
Refer to the requirements.txt file for all dependencies:

### *requirements.txt File:*
plaintext
PySide6==6.6.0
requests==2.31.0
Pillow==9.2.0
matplotlib==3.8.0
